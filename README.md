# UJournal

A silly, almost useless command-line note-taking application. Originally built for Windows, but it'll work on Linux and Mac once I start using libcurses instead of conio.

### Using UJournal

There's no build system yet, but I'll add one at some point.

### Features

* Write simple notes
* Save journals in an easy-to-read text format
* Load journals

###### Plans

* Set custom save/load paths
* .txt, .xml export **[coming soon]**
* Linux support with libcurses **[coming soon]**
* HTML export **[1.0]**
* Qt GUI **[1.0]**
* Build system **[1.0]**
