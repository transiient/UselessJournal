# Useless Journal

A silly command-line journal application I'm writing. It doesn't save notes after closing, but I'm planning to implement that. It *should*, theoretically, work on Linux as well as Windows but it hasn't been tested and that wasn't the aim. I may add Linux support in the future though.

### Building

Open up the solution file in Visual Studio and click Build. More instructions coming soon.

### Using UJ

UJ isn't exactly in a usable state. Just run `uselessjournal` in console and see for yourself.

### Features

Hah, good one.

###### Plans

* .txt, .xml export
* HTML export
* Full Linux support
* Qt GUI

### Licence

Useless Journal is licensed under the MIT Licence. Or at least it should be. Honestly I don't really care, it's just a bit of fun, right?
