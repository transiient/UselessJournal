# Useless Journal

A silly, almost useless command-line note-taking application. Built for Windows, but it *should* work on Linux as well (not yet tested).

### Using UJ

Just click Run in Visual Studio, you'll see why this is called Useless Journal.

### Features

* Write simple notes
* Save notes in an easy-to-read text format
* Load journals

###### Plans

* .txt, .xml export **[next version]**
* Confirmed Linux support **[coming soon]**
* HTML export **[1.0]**
* Qt GUI **[1.0]**
